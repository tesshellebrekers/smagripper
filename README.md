# smagripper

Adafruit_BNO055_WIRE1.cpp/h should be added to the BNO055 library in 
Documents/Arduino/libraries/Adafruit_BNO055 by just pasting them there.

FakeSerialData provides fake Values for IMU and Strain sensors.

SerialExampleOnfOff enables closing the gripper when the Arduino 
receives a 0.
